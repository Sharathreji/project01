<h2>Our Love Story ❤️</h2>
<p class="letter">
We met in JMP Hospital. I was the rude Public Relations Officer, and you were the innocent junior pharmacist who had no idea that the guy scolding you was actually falling for you faster than a nurse runs when someone shouts "sister!" 😳That day, a patient complained about the pharmacy and everyone pointed at you like you were the last bench student who didn’t do homework. You stood there… scared… confused… looking like a kitten who accidentally entered an operation theatre. And yes, I scolded you — but inside I was having a full love-at-first-sight meltdown. 

I called you three times that day — THREE. Madam didn’t pick a single one. She didn’t even know it was me. Meanwhile, I was checking my call log like a heartbroken Romeo. 

Slowly I started watching you every day (romantically… not CCTV level 👀). And when we finally talked, everything felt right — Then came the emotional earthquake — the day you asked to go home early. I said no, following rules like a strict Malayalam movie manager. But it got late… you had a long way… and you were on your period (which I didn’t know). You cried… and I felt like the villain in my own love story. 

Next day you tried to talk to me, but I avoided you — which I regret more than skipping petrol when the tank is empty. You apologised in public and I still acted tough. then Akshay the electrician entered the chat. ⚡(that annoyed me so much you guys sit together laugh and talk it was like a disaster for me) 

He also liked you. And I, being the strategic mastermind I am, had to gently *divert* him. Not hurt… just reroute… like a Google Maps update: “New destination → Anjana the pharmacist.” Mission successful without any shock hazards. (😎Biggest mistake of my life). 

But slowly… I made my way back into your world. I created silly excuses to talk to you. I prepared topics like a student preparing last-minute notes before exams. You finally spoke to me again… and we became friends, laughing and talking for hours. 
And then… on 11 January 2025 at 10:30 PM, I proposed. At 11 PM… you said YES. And my soul did a backflip. 

Today marks one year of us — one year of love, chaos, guilt, laughter, diversions, phone calls, and destiny. of us. One year of love, laughter, dumb fights, awkward moments, and a LOT of memories.

<h2>💌 For My Shuttumani 💌</h2>
<p class="letter">
My dearest Kavya,Happy Anniversary, my love. Every day with you feels like a story written with warmth, innocence, and mischief. You changed the way I see love—you made it softer, sweeter, more real.

You are the calm to my chaos, the innocence to my attitude, the softness to my rough days. I love you for everything you are—your kindness, your strength, your laughter, your stubbornness, and the way you make my world feel complete.

Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for loving me. And thank you… for picking up my call after months. ❤️🤣

I love you endlessly, 
    — Sharath (your appappi)❤️
