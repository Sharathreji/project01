    <h2>Our Love Story ❤️</h2>
    <p class="letter">
      We met in JMP Hospital. I was the rude Public Relations Officer, and you were the innocent junior pharmacist who had no idea that the guy scolding you was actually getting captivated by you.That day when a patient complained about the pharmacy and everyone pointed fingers at you... you looked scared, confused, like a small kitten caught in rain—but still innocent. And yes, I scolded you. But inside I was like: “Okay wow… who is she? 😳”

  I called you three times that day—THREE—madam didn’t pick up any of them. You didn’t even know it was me. And from that day onwards, I kept watching you (not creepy way…let's say… *romantically monitoring*). 😌

  Later when we talked, my dear friend Akshay the electrician also got interested in you. So I had to… uhm… use my smart PR skills and divert him toward Anjana the pharmacist. Mission successful. 😎💡

  Then one day you asked to go home early. I, being the rule-following strict PRO, said no. But it was getting dark… you had a long journey… and you were on your period (which I didn’t know). You cried. And my heart broke into 17 pieces. I told you to go quickly, but the guilt stayed.

  Next day you tried talking to me. But I avoided you… in public… which I regretted more than anything. 😔

  Slowly, patiently, I found my way back into your circle. I created silly excuses to talk to you. You finally spoke to me again and we became friends. Hours and hours of phone calls… sometimes with topics I prepared like I’m studying for UPSC. 🤣

  And then… on 11 January 2025 at 10:30 PM, I proposed to you. At 11 PM… you said YES. ❤️

  Today marks one year of us. One year of love, laughter, dumb fights, awkward moments, and a LOT of memories.

    <h2>💌 A Romantic Letter For You, Kavya 💌</h2>
    <p class="letter">
      My dearest Kavya,Happy Anniversary, my love. Every day with you feels like a story written with warmth, innocence, and mischief. You changed the way I see love—you made it softer, sweeter, more real.

  You are the calm to my chaos, the innocence to my attitude, the softness to my rough days. I love you for everything you are—your kindness, your strength, your laughter, your stubbornness, and the way you make my world feel complete.

  Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for loving me. And thank you… for picking up my call after months. ❤️🤣

  I love you endlessly,
  — Sharath ❤️
